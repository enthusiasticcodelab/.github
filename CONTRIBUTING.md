# Enthusiastic Code Lab Contributing Guide

Hi! We're really excited that you are interested in contributing to. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct]
- [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines)

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `main`, and merge back against that branch.

- If adding a new feature:

  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- If fixing bug:

  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.

- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - GitHub can automatically squash them before merging.

- Commit messages must follow the [commit message convention] so that changelogs can be automatically generated.

## Development Setup

You will need [pnpm].

After cloning the repo, run:

```sh
$ pnpm install
```
